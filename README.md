# The Great Wyrm War
My first (semi) big personal programing project.
You can check it out and participate via greendownhill.ir .
The project was for my homebrew DND campaing, and my friends could vote to join the army of one of the dragons and impact the story with their votes.

# Server
The server is actually my old laptop which sits in my room pluged in power 24/7. I know it's not practical but hey I'm just starting and I REALLY wanted to have a home server with zero budget. I found XAMPP the easiest web server for me and I stuck to it.

# Domain and Other cloud stuff
As I said I didn't wanted to spend the least amount of budget for this prodject so the .ir domain was cheapest I could find (Around 1 dollar per 3 years).
For achieving the all mighty http"S" I found parspack.com to be my best option. they provided SSL and CDN and other fun cloud stuff that I definitely didn't almost lose my mind over.

# The whole experience
I really had time making this website. like the week that I was working on this website I legit had fun. Even though bunch of my problems would have been solved with Javascript I pushed forward with the tools I had with my dear PHP. I really hope that in future I could expand this website and I hope I could use more complex programming to be more proud of my self.
